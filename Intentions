With this piece of art I intended to create a skull picure on my water bottle. I had a skull ornament left over from halloween and imagined it would look interesting to have it superimposed upon my regular household objects. Unfortuantly, I had trouble resizing the foreground image and have decided just to focus on the requirements for this assignment. I plan pursue this project in the future on my own time.
