Intentions

With this piece of art, I intended to create a skull picture on my water bottle. I had a skull ornament left over from Halloween and imagined it would look interesting to have it superimposed upon my regular household objects. Unfortunately, I had trouble resizing the foreground image and have decided to focus on this assignment's requirements. I plan to pursue this project in the future on my own time.
